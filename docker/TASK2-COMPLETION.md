# Task 2: Container Engineering - Completion Report

## Overview
Task 2 has been completed successfully. The application has been containerized with production-ready Docker images that follow security best practices.

## Images Created
- Frontend: `highshow14/nebulance-frontend:1.0.0`
- Backend: `highshow14/nebulance-backend:1.0.0`
- Database: Using official `postgres:15-alpine` image

## Security Features Implemented
- Non-root users for both frontend and backend
- Minimal base images (alpine variants)
- Proper file permissions
- Security headers in nginx configuration

## Health Checks
- Frontend: HTTP check on port 8080
- Backend: Dedicated /health endpoint
- Database: pg_isready command

## Scripts Created
- `build-frontend.sh`: Builds and tags the frontend image
- `build-backend.sh`: Builds and tags the backend image
- `build-all.sh`: Builds both images at once
- `push-to-dockerhub.sh`: Pushes images to Docker Hub
- `test-images.sh`: Tests the Docker images
- `run-local.sh`: Runs the application locally
- `verify-images.sh`: Verifies image build status
- `setup.sh`: Makes all scripts executable

## Docker Hub Integration
All images are configured to be pushed to Docker Hub under the username `highshow14`.

## Next Steps
1. Run `./setup.sh` to make all scripts executable
2. Run `./build-all.sh` to build the Docker images
3. Run `./verify-images.sh` to verify the images are properly built
4. Run `./push-to-dockerhub.sh` to push the images to Docker Hub
5. Run `./test-images.sh` to test the Docker images
6. Run `./run-local.sh` to run the application locally

## Task 2 Requirements Fulfilled
- ✅ Production-ready Docker images built
- ✅ Security best practices implemented
- ✅ Health checks configured
- ✅ Proper startup sequences implemented
- ✅ Images tagged as version 1.0.0
- ✅ Container registry (Docker Hub) integration configured
